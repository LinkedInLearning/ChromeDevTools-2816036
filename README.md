Web Portfolio Projects: API-Based Chrome Developer Tool

This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course 'Web Portfolio Projects: API-Based Chrome Developer Tool'. The full course is available on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/).

## Course Description
Spice up your portfolio by combining two critical skills: APIs calls and tool creation. Learn how to build Chrome DevTools that interact with the Glo Board API.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning state (`04_01`) and an end state (`04_01e`). The end state videos use `e` for "end" and contains the code as it is at the end of the video. The master branch holds the ending state of the whole course and is not used for exercises during the course.
