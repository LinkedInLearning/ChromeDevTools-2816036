Building web applications on APIs has become more and more standard, but it remains a difficult skill to master for developers. Working with the intricate connections of API-based applications can be challenging; however, you can build a developer tool, built into your browser, that communicates with web content and shows your skills to prospective employers. In this course, instructor Leigh Lawhon helps you combine two critical skills: APIs calls and developer tool creation. Using practical examples, Leigh demonstrates how to build a Chrome Developer Tool (DevTool) that interacts with the GitKraken Glo Board API. Along the way, she steps through the basics of working with APIs, how to authenticate using personal access tokens, and how to use Fetch and Promises to get data from the Glo Board API.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning state (`04_01`) and an end state (`04_01e`). The end state videos use `e` for "end" and contains the code as it is at the end of the video. The master branch holds the ending state of the whole course and is not used for exercises during the course.
